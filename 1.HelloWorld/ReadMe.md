# Learning Python
    Print is a function in python. In the hello world application we use the print function
to print Hello World! to the console.  We wrap the string Hello World! in quotations, it 
doesn't matter what kind of quotes you use as long as they match. 

The print function takes the "Hello World!" string argument. You can also use calculations.
When calling a function you must have parenthesis at the end of the function name.

# Learning Python
    Print is a function in python. In the hello world application we use the print function
to print Hello World! to the console.  We wrap the string Hello World! in quotations, it 
doesn't matter what kind of quotes you use as long as they match. 

The print function takes the "Hello World!" string argument. You can also use calculations.
When calling a function you must have parenthesis at the end of the function name.

When a program is running, everything the program needs ends up stored in the computer's 
memory.  The program code itself will be stored in one area of memory, and the data
it works on will also be stored somewhere in memory.

A variable is basically just a way to give a (meaningful) name to an area of memory, into 
which we can place certain values.

For example when we created the variable called greeting, Python allocates an area of 
memory for us.  It know to refer to that area whenever we talk about the variable greeting.

Because we created greeting by attaching it to a string value, Python also decided that greeting
was a variable of type string, and ensures that we can only do things with it that make sense for
strings.

There are a few rules for variable names:
    Python variable names must begin with a letter (either upper or lower case) or an
underscore _ character.
    They can contain letters, numbers or underscore characters (but cannot begin with a number)
    Python variables are case-sensitive, so greeting and Greeting would refer to 2 different
variables.
    Variables are created when they are first attached to a value, using =

Code I started with in this project

import random

highest = 1000
answer = random.randint(1, highest)
print(answer)  # TODO: Remove after testing.
# modify game to use a while loop to allow the player to continue guessing if guess is wron
print("Please guess a number between 1 and {}: ".format(highest))
guess = 0 # initialize to any number that isn't the answer
while guess != answer:
    guess = int(input())
    if guess == 0:
        break
    if guess == answer:
        print("Well done, you guessed the number!")
        break
    else:
        if guess < answer:
            print("Please guess higher!")
        else:
            print("Please guess lower!")
        guess = int(input())
        if guess == answer:
            print("Well done, you guessed the number!")
        else:
            print("Sorry, you have not guessed correctly!")



if guess != answer:
    if guess < answer:
        print("Please guess higher!")
    else:  # guess must be greater than answer
        print("Please guess lower!")
    guess = int(input())

    else:

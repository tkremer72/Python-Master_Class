 if Challenge

Write a small program to ask for a name and an age.

When both values have been entered, check if the person is the right age to go on an 18-30
holiday(they must be over 18 and under 31).

If they are, welcome them to the holiday, otherwise print a (polite) message refusing them
entry.

Our programs expect valid input.  We'll see how to handle invalid numbers, later in the
course.

Remember that human languages aren't always very precise.

Someone counts as "over 18" from 1 second after midnight on their birthday.

Their actual age equals 18, but they're counted as being over 18 when considering things like
voting, or getting a credit card.

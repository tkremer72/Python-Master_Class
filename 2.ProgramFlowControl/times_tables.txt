Mini Challenge

What happens if we:
    1. Indent the print("-" * 20) line another 4 spaces?
        prints the dashes under each iteration of the print on line three
    2. Remove the indent completely for that line?
        prints the dashes after the program is finished iterating over all of the numbers 1-12

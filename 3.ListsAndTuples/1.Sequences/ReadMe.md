# Lists And Tuples

When an object is described as immutable, that means it can't be changed.

The following immutable types are built into Python:
    int
    float
    bool(True and False): as described in int
    str
    tuple
    frozenset
    bytes

A mutable object is one whose value can be changed

Python has the following mutable objects built in
    list
    dict
    set
    Bytearray

enumerate is a built-in Python function that allows you to get the 
index, and the item from a list

Edge Cases:
In programming, an edge case typically involves input values that 
require special handling in an algorithm behind a computer program. As a 
measure for validating the behavior of computer programs in such cases, 
unit tests are usually created; they are testing boundary conditions of 
an algorithm, function or method. A series of edge cases around each 
"boundary" can be used to give reasonable coverage and confidence using 
the assumption that if it behaves correctly at the edges, it should 
behave everywhere else.[1]

For example, a function that divides two numbers might be tested using 
both very large and very small numbers. This assumes that if it works 
for both ends of the magnitude spectrum, it should work correctly in 
between.

Corner Cases:
In engineering, a corner case (or pathological case) involves a problem 
or situation that occurs only outside of normal operating 
parametersâ€”specifically one that manifests itself when multiple 
environmental variables or conditions are simultaneously at extreme 
levels, even though each parameter is within the specified range for 
that parameter.

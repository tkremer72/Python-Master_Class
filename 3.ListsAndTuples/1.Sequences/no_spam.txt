Nested List Challenge

Write code to print out all the meals in the menu, but with spam removed.

You can choose which approach you want to use:
    Remove spam from each list, then print the list
    Print out the items in each list, as long as it's not spam

You may want to write two sets of code, using both approaches.

It's up to you how you format the output.  What's important is that you
produce eight meals without spam.

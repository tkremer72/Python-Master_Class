Tuple are immutable
There are another couple of reasons for preferring a tuple over a list.
Both reasons are due to tuples being immutable.

the first reason is to protect the integrity of your data.

We've seen that attempting to change the value of a tuple gave an error
because tuples can't be changed.

Advantages of tuples
Using a tuple, for things that shouldn't change, can help prevent bugs
in your programs
Whe we tried to alter the tuple earlier, the program crashed.  Obviously
that's not good, but it's something that we'd spot when testing the code

Whe we used a list, the program didn't crash, and we ended up with
incorrect data.  That could be far worse than the program crashing.

I know this example is only the year that an album was released, but
what if we were displaying the medicines that could be used to treat a
certain disease?
A doctor, relying on our program, might prescribe something totally
unsuitable - with possibly fatal consequences.

If your code attempts to change one of the fields in a tuple, your code
will fail.  That will highlight something that your code probably should
not be doing.

The second advantage of tuples, is that you can always unpack them
successfully.

Because a tuple can't be changed, you always know how many items there
are to unpack.

That's why this is described as unpacking a tuple, even though you can
unpack any sequence type.

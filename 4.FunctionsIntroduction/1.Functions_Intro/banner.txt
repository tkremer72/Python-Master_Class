Create a function that will center the text in the window and also
include the asterisks as borders.

Challenge

Create the Docstring for this function.

You should document the exception that can be raised.

Search on-line for something like python exception in docstring to see
how to do that.

Hint: The return value shouldn't be documented - this function doesn't
return anything useful.

Coding Exercise 12. Augmented Assignment

augmented assignment in a loop

Early computers could only perform addition.  In order to multiply one number by another, they
performed repeated addition.

For example, 5 * 8 was performed by adding 5 eight times
5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 40

Use a for loop, and augmented assignment, to give answer the result of multiplying number by
multiplier.

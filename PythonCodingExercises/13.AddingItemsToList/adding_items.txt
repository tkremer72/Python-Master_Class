Adding items to lists
We have some data that contains a mixture of flowers and shrubs, in a
list.

Our customer would like two speparate lists

One, called flowers, will contain only flowers, and the other not
surprisingly called shrubs, must contain only shrubs.

Write the code to populate the two lists with the appropriate plants
from data.

The strings in the lists should remain unchanged.  If you decide to
delete "-Flower" and "-Shrub" from the strings, that's a great
improvement but isn't required to complete this exercise.  But be
warned, the on-line checker will fail your code if you attempt to delete
those redundant characters but leave a trailing space in the strings.

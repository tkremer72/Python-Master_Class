Coding exercise 16. Sum even or odd numbers in a range

In this coding exercise, you have to write a function named sum_eo with
the following parameters.
n: a positive number
t: a string

if t has the value 'e', the function should return the sum of all even
natural numbers less than n.

if t has the value of 'o', the function should return the sum of all odd
natural numbers less than n

For any other values of t return -1

Examples:
sum_eo(10, 'e') should return 20 since 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20
sum_eo(7, 'o') should return 9 since 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
sum_eo(11, 'spam') should return -1

Coding exercise 17. Fizz Buzz

For this exercise you will write a function that returns the next answer,
in the game of fizz buzz.

It's a simple game, usually played with 2 or more people.

You start counting in turn.  That's easy enough, but there's a
complication.

If the number is divisible by 3, you say "fizz" instead.

If it's divisible by 5, you say "buzz".

And if it's divisible by both, you say "fizz buzz"

Tje function must be called fizz_buzz.

Your fizz_buzz function should return the correct word("fizz", "buzz", "
fizz buzz"), or the number if it's not divisible by either 3 or 5.

The function will always return a string.  When you return the number,
therefore you should convert it to a string first.

Remember to annotate your function, and include a Docstring.

Include a for loop, to test your function for values 1 to 100.

Change the for loop from coding exercise 17 so that it is using the
function and allowing the user and the computer to take turns.

Pseudocode:

Calculate the computer's number(which may be a number, "fizz", "buzz",
or "fizz buzz")

Print the computers response.

Calculate the players response.

Calculate the players correct answer.

Get input from the player.

compare the correct answer to the players input.

Repeat until the player makes a mistake, or the game reaches 100

Print a suitable message: "Congratulations!" or "Wrong!"

Call fizz_buzz() and print the result
(Need to pass a variable to fizz_buzz)
Calculate the players correct answer
(Increment the variable that was passed to fizz_buzz, and use it again
here)
Get input from the player
Check the players input against the correct answer
If it's not correct, break out of the loop Print a "Wrong!" message
Repeat until the game reaches 100
Print a suitable "Congratulations!" message

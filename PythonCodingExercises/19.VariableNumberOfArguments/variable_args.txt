Coding exercise 19. Variable number of arguments

Write a function to calculate the sum of all numbers passed as its
arguments.

Your function should be called sum_numbers and should take a single
argument: the value to sum up to.

Don't forget your Docstring

The parameters and return value must be annotated.  Be careful here, you
may want to review the lecture Function annotation and type hints, or
check PEP 484 to see what it says about annotationg numerical arguments
and return types.

Test the function with the following values.

values                      Result
1, 2, 3                     6
8, 20, 2                    30
12.5, 3.147, 98.1           113.747
1.1, 2.2, 5.5               8.8

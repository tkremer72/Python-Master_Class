# Coding exercise 4 If With Strings

Write a small program that assigns the name of 2 trees to 2 variables, called tree1 and tree2.
If the values of the 2 variables are equal, print the message "The trees are the same" otherwise
print "The trees are different".

This exercise system doesn't allow input to be used, so don't us input on lines 1 and 2 - just
enter your text inside the quotes for the 2 trees.

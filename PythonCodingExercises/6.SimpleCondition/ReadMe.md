# Coding exercise 6 Simple Condition

Write a small program that assigns the value 5 to one variable, called x, and the value 7 to
another, called y.

Your program should then us an if statement to compare the values, and print out "x is greater 
than y" if x is greater, or "x is smaller than y" if y is greater.  If x equals y, print out 
"x equals y".

I know you don't really need a computer to tel you the result, but we're getting practice at 
writing if/elif/else statements.

Once your program is working, copy and paste it into a new file in your IDE, and test it with 
different values for x and y.

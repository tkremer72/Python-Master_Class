# Code Blocks
Like many programming languages, Python works in blocks of code.
One of the design principles of Python, though, was that it should be uncluttered and easy to read.
Because of this, Python doesn't use delimiters around blocks of code.

Other languages use braces {} or Begin and End around code.  Python doesn't use anything like that, but instead uses indentation to indicate when a new block starts.
